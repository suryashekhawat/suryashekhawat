### Hi there 👋

As a Full Stack Engineer, I bring extensive experience in designing, developing, and deploying web applications. With a strong background in both front-end and back-end development, I have a solid understanding of various programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

In my previous roles, I have worked on complex projects that required me to collaborate with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to deliver scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications. I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Angular, Node.js, Python, and SQL, and have experience working with cloud platforms such as AWS and DigitalOcean, Openshift.

I possess excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver high-quality code within tight deadlines. Additionally, I have a strong understanding of software development methodologies and practices, including Agile.
